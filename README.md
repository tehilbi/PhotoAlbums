Exercise
Using the site: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and the photos dataset, write a react.js app that would:

1. Build the main page according to the attached design.
2. Use a lazy loading pattern to be well performed.
3. When a thumbnail is clicked, a modal will pop open (free-style design) showing the title, the photo, the album, and the photo id.
4. The main screen on the app should enumerate the existing albums, and a dropdown will let you choose a specific album and only show that album when chosen (by default, show the first album).

Bonus:

-   The application should have a search bar that will search the title field of all photos. Inputting partial text should immediately show the corresponding thumbnails.

Note that:
The application must be a single-page application (SPA).
The application must be divided into components.
The design should be responsive only to standard desktop screens.
